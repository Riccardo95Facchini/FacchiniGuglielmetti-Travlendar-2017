\subsection{Product Perspective}
The system will have three main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mobile application version for phones and tablets.
\item Web browser version.
\item Backend structure to support the functioning of the service.
\end{enumerate}
While the backend structure is needed for the functioning of the service provided, only one of the two applications is needed to interact with the system.\\
APIs for each component must be provided in order to allow future development and introduction of new functionalities like an automated system for buying of public transportation vehicles.\par
