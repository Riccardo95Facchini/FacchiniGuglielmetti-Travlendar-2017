\subsection{Purpose}
This document aims to detail the design of the software and of the architecture regarding the system of Travlendar+.
To do so it will be taken a more detailed approach for the description of each component and the overall architecture of the system, by also pointing out the relations between each module and giving a description of such relationships.

\subsection{Scope}
