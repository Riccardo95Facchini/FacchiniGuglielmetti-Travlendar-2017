\subsection{Purpose}
This document aims to detail the design of the software and of the architecture regarding the system of Travlendar+.
To do so it will be taken a more detailed approach for the description of each component and the overall architecture of the system, by also pointing out the relations between each module and giving a description of such relationships.

\subsection{Scope}
Travlendar+ is a time/travel management web-based system, designed to help the users to keep track of their daily routine by scheduling for them the best way to move from one place to the other using all the information given by the users themselves and external data in order to deliver a tailored experience for everyone.\\
After the user enters all the needed data to register an event, the system will automatically alert him/her when itâ€™s time to leave and will give directions to reach each one of the means of travel as specified in the options, taking into account also factors like the weather and possible public transportation strikes.
